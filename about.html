          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>GrillMaster's Gourmet Burgers was founded in 2010 with a simple mission: to serve the most delicious and
            mouthwatering burgers in town. What started as a small food truck has now grown into a beloved burger
            destination, known for its quality ingredients, exceptional flavors, and friendly service.</p>
          <p>At GrillMaster's, we believe in using only the finest, freshest ingredients to craft our burgers. Each
            patty is made from 100% pure beef, seasoned to perfection and grilled to juicy perfection. Our buns are
            baked fresh daily, and our toppings are hand-selected for their flavor and quality.</p>
